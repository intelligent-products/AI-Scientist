Modify the configure_optimizers function to assign different learning rates to different layers, with deeper layers having lower learning rates.

Implement a regularization term in the loss function that penalizes the dot product of query, key, and value matrices across different heads. Evaluate the impact on training dynamics, convergence speed, final performance, and interpretability of the model by monitoring both performance metrics and the diversity of attention patterns.",
